# Neue OSD Font

![Preview](img/Neue_template.png)

This is a font set for Caddx/Walksnail [Avatar Digital VTX System](https://caddxfpv.com/collections/walksnail-avatar-system).
Literally converted from [WTF-Neue-OSD](https://github.com/Kw0ngk4n/WTF-Neue-OSD)
Original Typeface based on [The Neue Black](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/the-neue-black), hence the name.  
Icons mostly based on [Google Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons).  
Only Betaflight is supported.
